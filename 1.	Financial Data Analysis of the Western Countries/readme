About:
~ The dataset is about the "Western Countries Financial Data"
~ The dataset contains financial information regarding the sale of company products across different countries and segments in the year 2013 and 2014.
~ The dataset that we will be analyzing consists of financial data for 6 products sold across 5 countries.
~ The product is sold in various segments, namely:
        - Channel Partners, Enterprise, Government, Midmarket, and Small Business.
~ The product is being sold across different countries, which include:
        - Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, and the USA.
~ The product line includes multiple varieties, which are:
        - Amarilla, Carretera, Montana, Paseo, Velo, and VTT.
~ The discount on gross sale is determined based on the discount band, which consists of four categories:
        - None (0%), Low (1-4%), Medium (5-9%), High (10-15%).


Conclusion and Inferences:
After conducting a comprehensive analysis of the financial dataset, we have arrived at several key insights. These insights are as follows:
  ~ Sales performance in the Channel Partners and Midmarket Segments was low and requires further investigation.
  ~ Paseo was the most popular product across all segments in all five countries.
  ~ The Government segment was the most profitable and generated the highest sales.
  ~ Carretera was the least profitable product.
  ~ The Enterprise segment recorded a loss of $(614.55K), with total discounts exceeding one million dollars. Therefore, there is a need for increased focus and improvement in this segment.
  ~ While all five countries contributed almost equally to sales and profit, France was the most profitable country, and the USA had the highest sales.
  ~ Sales showed a gradual increase in the first three quarters, with a sharp increase in the fourth quarter, indicating that people tend to buy more towards the end of the year.
  ~ Discounts had a positive impact on product sales, leading to increased demand. Conversely, sales were observed to be lower in the absence of any discount.
These findings highlight the importance of identifying and addressing areas of weakness, focusing on high-performing products and segments, and leveraging discounts to increase sales.
